To determine if an animated mesh is humanoid, we can examine its structure and look for features that are typically associated with humanoids. A general approach might include:

1. **Skeleton Structure**: Check if the mesh has a skeleton, and if so, whether the skeleton has joints or bones that match typical humanoid naming conventions or structures (e.g., head, arms, legs).
1. **Mesh Topology**: Look for humanoid features in the mesh itself, such as a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.
1. **Animation**: If the mesh is animated, see if the animations are typical of humanoid movements.
To accomplish this, we'll utilize the bpy module, which is Blender's Python API. This will allow us to import the FBX file into Blender, inspect its contents, and determine if it has humanoid characteristics.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps we'll take:

- [x] Import the FBX file into Blender.
- [x] Check the skeleton structure for humanoid bones.
- [x] If the skeleton is humanoid, confirm by checking the mesh topology.
- [x] Optionally, check the animations if present.
